    <p> I often pay visit to Quora to refresh myself. And, I do love reading and exploring on Quora in my free time. Quora is filled with many great individuals, and an average individual gets introduced to their pattern and style of thinking through Quora.

        It amuses me to see great personalities such as Bjarne Stroustop ,Jimmy Wales and Thomas Cormen present actively on Quora.
